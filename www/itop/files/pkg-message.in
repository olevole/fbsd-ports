Installation:

1. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is running in
   safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from the owner of
   other scripts will be a problem).
   Check the access rights on the files/folders: the setup needs to have write
   access either to the whole directory where iTop is installed or to the following
   subdirectories (create them if needed)
    - conf
    - data
    - env-production
    - log

2. Open the main iTop directory in your web browser. iTop should then display
   the setup instructions on screen.
